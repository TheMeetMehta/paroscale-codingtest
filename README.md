Problem Statement 1:
Write the program in NodeJs using plain javascript to find the combinations of numbers from
an array, where addition of any two numbers from the array is a number from the same
array.
Ex: arr = [ 2, 3, 11, 30, 3, 1, 4, 14, 27, 17, 5 ]
So from this array, the combinations could be,
2, 3, 5 (as 2 + 3 = 5)
1, 3, 4
3, 14, 17
And so one ...
The user should be able to pass a list of numbers as an input array to the program.
The output should be the combinations printed on the console.
It is expected to find the optimal solutions both for time complexity and space complexity.
There could be multiple solutions. For all the solutions it is expected to showcase the base
case and the worst case scenario.

Problem Statement 2:
Build RESTFUL CRUD API using NodeJs + ExpressJs + Mongoose + MongoDB for
Geolocation queries. The Objective is to build a RESTFUL CRUD API service for listing
users from the MongoDB database. It should be possible to list the users based on their
geolocation.
Assume the User has properties such as Name, Age, Phone Number and Location.
API to be developed
1. Add User API
2. Get User API based on nearby geolocation coordinates
3. Get User API based on partial matching name
4. Update User API
5. Delete User API

You can use Postman to demonstrate the APIs.
