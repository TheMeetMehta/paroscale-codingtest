<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function loops through the array twice.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function creates a map of all numbers in the array. The result array could also have a maximum length of n/3 if all numbers in the array form a combination with two other numbers in the array.</p>
